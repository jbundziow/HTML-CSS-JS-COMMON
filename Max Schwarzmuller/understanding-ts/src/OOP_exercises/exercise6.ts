// Exercise 6: Geometric Shapes
/*
Implement a program that works with geometric shapes. Create an abstract class Shape with properties like x and y coordinates, and a method to calculate perimeter.
Derive classes like Circle, Square, and Triangle. Use polymorphism to calculate perimeters of different shapes.
