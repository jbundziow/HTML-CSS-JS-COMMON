// Exercise 4: Vehicle Inheritance
/*
Design a class hierarchy for vehicles. Start with a base class Vehicle with properties like make, model, and methods like startEngine().
Create subclasses like Car, Motorcycle, and Truck, each with specific methods or properties.
Demonstrate how polymorphism works by calling the startEngine() method on different types of vehicles.
